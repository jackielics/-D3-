### time_scale_data.csv

This file consists of a daily time series, from January 1 through 31, 2017.  The "Amount" value in each row is semi-random, and was generated by me, Scott Murray, using the Numbers spreadsheet application.

You are welcome to use, reuse, adapt, and republish these random numbers in any context.  They are about as useful as [Dilbertâ€™s budget numbers](http://dilbert.com/strip/1999-04-27).
