### us-states.json

This file consists of GeoJSON data generated by Mike Bostock from U.S. Census data, and is in the public domain.  This file used to be included in earlier versions of the D3 repository, and included this summary on its origins:

> These are derived from the cartographic boundary files from the 2000 [U.S. Census](http://www.census.gov/geo/www/cob/bdy_files.html
). Then, MapShaper was used to simplify the geometry, and ogr2ogr to convert the shapefiles to GeoJSON. Some additional work was done to preserve the FIPS codes, which are dropped from the shapefiles by MapShaper.
